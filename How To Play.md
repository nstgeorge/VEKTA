# How To Play

## Objectives and Goals

The objective of Vekta is to explore a procedurally generated universe!

How specifically you want to go about doing this is entirely up to you, but here's how you could start:

1: Find a planet to dock at. Planets are sometimes populated, and you'll be able to
receive missions, trade, find context sensitive events, and more.

2: Take on a mission! Missions are randomly generated, so your goal may vary. However, the majority of
them generally require traveling to a different planet. You can use the mission radar to track down your destination.

3: Start trading cargo between planets! This is pretty self-explanatory, but see if you can make a profit by transferring
cargo.

4: Encounter a random event. Fly around until you spot an anomaly and try not to get blown up!

5: Target an asteroid, or perhaps another ship!

6: Buy or salvage upgrades for your ship!

7: Fly into a black hole. Self-explanatory.

8: And more! As the game gets developed, new random events and features will be added to keep players engaged.

## Controls

NOTE: Keybindings can be adjusted in the settings. This section is to explain how exactly to use various control 
features with default keybindings.

To start, Vekta tries to conform with actual physics. This means sometimes things in space can be difficult such as stopping.
Always keep in mind that the amount of speed you built up while flying is equivalent to the amount of speed you need to direct
in the other direction to stop. That said, the scroll wheel is your friend. Speed allocation is based upon perspective and the
more zoomed out you are the quicker you can build up that speed. It also makes it significantly easier to land on planets with
frequent adjustments to the perspective via the scroll wheel. If you are pursuing an objective, tab can be used to auto zoom
based upon proximity as well. Z and X are also hotkeys to zoom in and out respectively.

If you ever need to quick save before doing something stupid, like passing within 500m of the event horizon of a black hole,
you can do so with numpad5! The game tends to save at specific points such as landing on a planet, but nothing beats a manual save.
Also, the game will auto-save whenever you pause or enter a menu. You can also quick-save and quick-load using the F5 and F9 keys, respectively.

This movement style for the ship follows basic tank controls! Hello mid 90s survivial horror! You can use A and D to rotate left and
right, and W and S to accelerate forward and backward. 

You may find yourself in combat, so it's important to remember that this game is physics based. Your projectiles can be fired off with
Space, and you can deploy countermeasures with Ctrl.

Here is a list of the following ship related commands outside of combat:

V) lets you see your ship's menu.
Y) lets you access your ship's internet.
C) lets you access your ship's knowledge.
Q) lets you access your ship's list of missions
R) lets you scan with your ship.
T) autotargets something.
I) lets you access your ship's inventory.
F) activates your ship's hyperdrive.
1) lets you target a planet with your ship's radar.
2) lets you target an asteroid.
3) lets you target another ship.
4) displays your ship's current objective.

With that, you should have a pretty decent starter understanding of the game!
